# Introduction

Webhook provides a server-to-server messaging system that facilitates communication regarding various transaction types and agreement-related changes. The service enables your systems to receive notifications about important events such as refunds, voids, or agreement modifications.

You have the flexibility to choose the specific transaction types or agreement actions you want to receive messages for. Once selected, the webhook service will deliver relevant information for those actions. These events may include:

- Transactions processed through payment processing APIs like Hosted Payment Pages or Remote.
- Manually processed transactions through the Merchant Administration System.
- Agreement-related changes made via the system or API.

Each message is transmitted as an HTTP POST request to a pre-configured URL.

## Service Configuration

To configure webhook notifications, navigate to the **Merchant Administration System** and select either the **â€˜Payment Pageâ€™** or **â€˜Securityâ€™** menu, then click on the **â€˜Transaction Adviceâ€™** option.

This will display the configuration page, where you can specify the transaction types or agreement actions for which you want to receive notifications. You can also choose to receive messages **only for transactions that have been authorised** (transaction status `A` or `H`).

> ðŸ“˜ **Note:**  
> If the "Only include authorised transactions (status 'A' or 'H')" option is not selected, then declined transaction data will also be sent along with authorised entries.

You will need to supply the URL that is to be used by the advice service. This URL must use either the **HTTP or HTTPS** protocol and must be on either port **80 or 443**. The connection is a direct server-to-server connection with no browser involvement, so the URL must be accessible over the internet.

## Message Delivery

Webhook messages are sent immediately after transaction processing or agreement actions. If delivery fails:

1. A retry will be attempted after a short delay.
2. Up to **4 retries** will be made, with increasing delay intervals.
3. The receiving system **must respond with HTTP 200 OK** for successful receipt.

## Data Security

To authenticate webhook messages, a **SHA1 hash check** is used with key transaction, card, billing, or agreement fields.

### Hashing Process

1. Concatenate field values using `:` as a separator.
2. Convert percent-encoded characters (e.g., `%20`) to their original characters.
3. Generate a **SHA1 hash** of the string.
4. Compare with the received hash value.
