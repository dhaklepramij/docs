|-------|----------------------------------------|-------------|
| 200   | OK                                     | Everything worked as expected. |
| 201   | Created                                | The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created. |
| 204   | No Content                             | The request was successful, but there is no response body. |
| 400   | Bad Request                            | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |
| 401   | Unauthorized                           | No valid API key provided. |
| 402   | Request Failed                         | The parameters were valid, but the request failed. |
| 403   | Forbidden                              | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request. |
