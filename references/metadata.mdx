## Test Cards

These card numbers can be used when testing your integration to the payment gateway. These cards will not work for live transactions.

The card security code (CVV) to use with the test cards is 123 (except for American Express, which should be 1234) for an authorised response, other codes will be declined.

Cards which show ‘Yes’ in the 3DS column will use a simulated 3D Secure authentication page, allowing you to test the transaction flow when Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode is used.
