# Sandbox Environment  

Omnispay provides a **sandbox environment** to allow developers to test APIs without performing real transactions. The sandbox mimics the production environment, enabling you to integrate and validate your implementation before going live.  

---

## Why Use the Sandbox?  

- **Safe Testing:** Test API calls without affecting real users or funds.  
- **Realistic Simulations:** Simulates responses similar to the production environment.  
- **Free of Cost:** No actual transactions occur, so you won’t be charged.  
- **Debugging & Validation:** Identify issues before deployment.

## How to Access the Sandbox  

To start testing in the **sandbox environment**, you need to generate an **API Key**.  

### **Step 1: Get Your Sandbox API Key**  

1. **Log in** to your Omnispay developer dashboard.  
2. Navigate to the **Sandbox API Keys** section.  
3. Click on **Generate API Key**.  
4. Copy the API key for testing purposes.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** The sandbox API key is different from the production API key. Ensure that you replace it with a live API key when moving to production.

## Authentication in Sandbox  

All sandbox API requests must include the API key in the request header.  

### **Sandbox API Request Example**  

```bash

curl --location 'https://demo.omnispay.com/business-details' \
--header 'apiKey: op_test_QmEB3OK3rjTZS1SFosqHy4MUFABjsXUxANWWh198y5uv'
