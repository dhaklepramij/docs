# Soft Delete Payment Link

This endpoint allows merchants to perform a **soft delete** on a payment link record in the database. A soft delete means that the record is not permanently removed but is marked as inactive.

## Path Parameters

- **id** (string, required):  
  The unique identifier (Order ID) of the payment link record to be deleted.  
  - Example: `1234567890`  
  - The API will update the status of the specified payment link record to indicate that it is deleted.

ðŸ“Œ **How it Works**  
If a valid `id` is provided, the API will update the record's status instead of permanently removing it. The record remains in the database but is no longer considered active.

## Request Headers

- **User-Agent** (string, optional): The User-Agent header, which is not mandatory.

## Example Request

```http
PUT /payment-link/delete/1234567890
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
