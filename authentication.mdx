### Authentication with Omnispay

To get authenticated and start making API calls, you'll first need to retrieve your **API key** from the Omnispay dashboard.

#### Prerequisite: Generate an API Key

Before making API requests, the merchant must generate an API key by sending a request to the API. The response will contain the API key details, which should be used to authenticate subsequent requests.

#### Step 1: Retrieve your API Key

To obtain your API key:

1. **Log in** to your Omnispay dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Developer Page**.
3. **Copy your API Key** from the page.


#### Step 2: API Key Validation

Before making any request, the client must include an API key in the request header. Upon receiving the request, the backend will perform the following:

1. **Check the API Key**:
   - First check if the request contains a valid API key in the header.
   - Verify whether the API key has the proper access to the requested endpoints.
   - Check if the request originates from an IP address that has been granted permission for that API key.
   - If all these validations pass, the user can access the requested resources.
   - If the URL or IP does not have the necessary permissions, the user can update their allowed endpoints and IP addresses against the API key.
   - If the API key is missing, the request will be rejected with a proper error message.
