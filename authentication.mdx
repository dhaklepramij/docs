### Authentication with Omnispay

To get authenticated and start making API calls, you'll first need to retrieve your **API key** from the Omnispay dashboard.

#### Step 1: Retrieve your API Key

To obtain your API key:

1. **Log in** to your Omnispay dashboard.
2. Navigate to the **Developer Page**.
3. **Copy your API Key** from the page.


#### Step 2: API Key Validation

Before making any request, the client must include an API key in the request header. Upon receiving the request, the backend will perform the following:

1. **Check the API Key**:
   - The backend will first check if the request contains a valid API key in the header.
   - If the API key is missing, the request will be rejected with a proper error message.

2. **Create an APIKeyRequest Object**:
   The backend will create an `ApiKeyRequest` object with the following details extracted from the request:
   
   ```java
   public class ApiKeyRequest {
       @NotBlank(message = "Please enter apiKey.")
       private String apiKey;

       @NotBlank(message = "ipAddress cannot be blank")
       private String ipAddress;

       @NotBlank(message = "url cannot be blank")
       private String url;

       @NotBlank(message = "http method cannot be blank")
       private String httpMethod;
   }
